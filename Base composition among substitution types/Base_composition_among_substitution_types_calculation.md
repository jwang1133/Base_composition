### Scripts to calculate the base composition among substitution types ###

**Note: here I use maize 'AC' substitution type as an example to show the calculation. The analysis in soybean follow the same approach, just change the name of the input file**

**1. Run the script named maize\_subgroup\_basecontent\_from\_chromosome\_hmp.pl** 

After the run the script, the output file is named as **maize100\_Subgroup\_AC\_ATCG\_maf5\_miss20**ï¼Œ with the same approach, you can obtain the result for all the other 5 substitution types.

**2. Format the file for plotting**

The formatted file is stored in file named as **maize\_subgroup\_basecontent**

And the soybean data is stored in file named as **soybean\_subgroup\_basecontent**
