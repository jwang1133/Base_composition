### Scripts to calculate the base composition value from genome-wide SNPs ###


**1. Calculate the base composition from maize genome wide SNPs**

Use script named **maize\_base\_composition\_calculation\_from\_chromosome\_hmp.pl**

**2. Calculate the base composition from soybean genome wide SNPs**

Use script named **soybean\_base\_composition\_calculation\_from\_chromosome\_hmp.pl**


### After run above script, format the base composition value in excel ###

The formatted data are stored in file named as **maize100\_AT\_CG\_maf5\_miss20** and **Gm302\_AT\_CG\_maf5\_miss20**

And those formatted data can be used to plot figure1.
